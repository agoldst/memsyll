# A pandoc template for typesetting a course syllabus

This repository gives a setup for generating a syllabus in PDF from source files in markdown (pandoc's variant) and a bibliographic database in biblatex format. The typesetting and layout are governed by a supplied pandoc template, which has some options that can be tweaked via template variables. The PDF generation process is automated with the included Makefile. `make` will join together almost all `.md`  and `.yaml` files in the directory and generate `out/syllabus.pdf` (on my system it comes out [like this](https://andrewgoldstone.com/memsyll/syllabus.pdf)).

The (silly) example files show how I recommend this setup be used. Markdown files are concatenated in alphabetical order, so if you are using multiple files I suggest putting numbers at start of their names (as here). You can of course have just the one markdown file if you prefer; you can also edit the `syllabus_md` variable in the Makefile to be an explicit list (in order) of files. `syllabus.yaml` includes some metadata as well as a number of template variables for adjusting the appearance of the PDF.

This `README.md` is excluded, as are the files named in the Make variable `other_mds`. The latter is meant for separate files you wish to generate in the same way; this repository includes an example, `booklist.md`, which I use to create a handout with a list of books that students need to buy (whereas the syllabus lists everything we have to read, including material from the library's digital collection, online, etc.).


In order not to clutter up the main directory with TeX's many auxiliary files, outputs go in an `out` subdirectory. These files are removed if generation is successful. If it is not and you wish to examine errors, try `make latex_quiet=""` which ensures verbose output from TeX.

## HTML version

I always want a web-friendly version of the reading schedule and bibliography portion of the syllabus as well. Working from markdown should make that simple enough, but pandoc and CSL run into endless trouble with a biblatex bibliography of any complexity. For a long time I relied on some complicated kludges using the venerable tex4t and a custom python script, [clean4ht](clean4ht) relying on the [pandocfilters](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandocfilters) python module. I'm leaving these around the repository though I can't imagine anyone has ever used them.

As for me, I've given up. I hand-create a webpage and manually update it when I update the syllabus. 

## Installation

Clone the repository. The two `.latex` template files can stay in the folder with the syllabus or be moved to `~/.pandoc/templates`. 

## More details on settings and options

Typography: the first page will set the course `title` and `subtitle` in `titlefont` over a rule, then put the `course-info` in a left-flush block (note that the `author` is only used in the PDF metadata; put your name in `course-info`). To remove this and make your own title block, set `custom-title: true`. The page headers and footers can be set with `o[lcr][head|foot]` (if `classoption: [twoside]` is given then `e[lcr][head|foot]` can be used as well).

This setup uses system fonts: set `mainfont`, `mainfontoptions`, and `titlefont` to the names of fonts to be used by XeLaTeX. Garamond Premier Pro is a commercial font, available as part of the Adobe [Font Folio Education Essentials](http://www.adobe.com/products/fontfolio-education-essentials.html), but of course choose anything you like. The gods will smite you if you choose Times New Roman.

Margins are set with the `hmargin` and `vmargin` template variables, which should be set to TeX dimensions. The default typeblock for the memoir package is meant for continuous text rather than the list-like form of the syllabus, which I think can tolerate narrower margins.

I do citations and bibliography via `biblatex-chicago`: this template implements this if you set `biblatex: true` and `biblatex-chicago: true`. The **bibliography file path is relative to the** `out` **directory** (which is created by the Make rules). So if, as in the example files here, the bibliography lives in the same directory as the markdown files and is called `sources.bib`, then the template variable is `bibliography: ../sources.bib`. 
In return for this quirky setup, all intermediate latex, biblatex, etc. outputs are corralled in an `out` folder which is created when you executed `make syllabus.pdf`. `latexmk` is used to automate `xelatex` and `biber` processing runs. (In the HTML generation, a second level of temporary file is required and the bibliography path is relative to `out/tmp`, which is why [schedule-page.md](schedule-page.md) has `bibliography: ../../sources.bib`.)

All cited sources appear as a list of "Readings" at the end of the syllabus. If `bibcols: 2` is given, then readings are printed as two columns of small type. To reject all this and do the printing and formatting of the bibliography yourself (e.g. if you want it in sections), set `custom-bib: true`. To cite sources in e.g. a schedule of assigned reading, I suggest using pandoc's syntax, `[@casanova:world, 1â€“40].`. This is what I have done in [the sample schedule](4schedule.md). This will generate short citations (that are also clickable links to the bibliography). One can also use biblatex citation commands directly.

Put `\nocite{*}` somewhere in the markdown if you want everything in your bibliography file to appear in the list of readings.

As the sample schedule file shows, unnumbered lists are also configured without bullet points, because the 1990s are over.

If template field `thanks` is set, is appears under the heading "Acknowledgments" after the list of Readings.

This repository is based on my more general [memarticle](https://github.com/agoldst/memarticle) pandoc/latex template. One disadvantage of using custom pandoc templates is that pandoc's latex output assumes all kinds of things will be set up as in the default latex template. If pandoc changes its default templates, mine fall out of sync until I notice and fix it.

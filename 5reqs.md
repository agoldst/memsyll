# Grading

The final grade will be calculated as follows:

> grade = 0.15(participation) + 0.25(paper 1)  
> \phantom{grade }+ 0.1(presentation) + 0.50(paper 2)

Each grade is given on the four-point scale as specified in the Undergraduate Catalog. In converting the final numerical score to a letter, the equivalents in the Catalog are used as follows:

----------                  --
3.5 < grade ≤ 4.0           A
3.0 < grade ≤ 3.5           B+
2.5 < grade ≤ 3.0           B
2.0 < grade ≤ 2.5           C+
1.0 < grade ≤ 2.0           C
0.5 < grade ≤ 1.0           D
\phantom{0.5 < }grade ≤ 0.5 F
----------                  --

The final grade will be based on a numerical score but is subject to my discretion. Unsatisfactory work in all areas of the course will result in an F even if the numerical score corresponds to a passing grade.

## Participation

Attendance and active, thoughtful participation in discussion are required. Lateness, lack of preparation (including coming to class without the assigned text in printed form), and disruptive behavior affect the participation mark.

If you miss three or more classes without excuse, the *maximum* participation mark you can receive is 3.0 out of 4.0. Missing more than five meetings without an excuse will normally result in a failing grade for the course. 

If you fall ill or miss class for a family emergency, please contact me as soon as possible; you can make up for an excused absence.
